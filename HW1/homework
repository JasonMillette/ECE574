Analysis:
a. 
	1 thread:
		time = 118.93s
		GFLOPs = 4.485e+01
	2 threads:
		time = 62.10s
		GFLOPs = 8.590e+01
	4 threads:
		time = 34.61s
		GFLOPs = 1.541e+02
	8 threads:
		time = 20.60
		GFLOPs = 2.589e+02

b. 
	2 threads speedup = 1.9151
	4 threads speedup = 3.4363
	8 threads speedup = 5.7733

	2 threads parallel efficiency = 0.9576
	4 threads parallel efficiency = 0.8591
	8 threads parallel efficiency = 0.7217

	The benchmark shows strong scaling as adding more threads does not increase the problem set.

	The benchmark does not show weak scaling as adding more threads did not increase the problem size.

	HPL gives the time it took to perform the math, where time is showing the total time the program ran.

	The user space is the time it took on all cores combined.

3. 
	a. 62.91% dgemm_kernel
	b. 0.93 vmovups (%r15),%ymm3
	c. skidding could cause the infromation to be incorrect.
