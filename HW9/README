Name: Jason Millette


Timing on NVIDIA GPU:
	Load time: 98922
	Convolve time: 48475
	Copy time: 26377
	Combine time: 57300
	Store time: 114906
	Total time = 871108

Timing on Intel-optimized CPU:
	Load time: 98889
	Convolve time: 27803
	Copy time: 32270
	Combine time: 35525
	Store time: 115411
	Total time = 721799

Timing on portable POCL driver:
	Load time: 112554
	Convolve time: 206141
	Copy time: 36104
	Combine time: 297545
	Store time: 98592
	Total time = 1474428

Timing of your CUDA code:
	Load time: 102081
	Convolve time: 275499
	Copy time: 26967
	Combine time: 45966
	Store time: 114394
	Total time = 565743

Question:  Which ran faster and why?

CUDA code was faster as it is optimized for Nvidia GPUs.
